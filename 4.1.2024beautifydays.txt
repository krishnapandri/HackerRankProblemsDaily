Lily likes to play games with integers. She has created a new game where she determines the difference between a number and its reverse. For instance, given the number , its reverse is . Their difference is . The number  reversed is , and their difference is .

She decides to apply her game to decision making. She will look at a numbered range of days and will only go to a movie on a beautiful day.

Given a range of numbered days,  and a number , determine the number of days in the range that are beautiful. Beautiful numbers are defined as numbers where  is evenly divisible by . If a day's value is a beautiful number, it is a beautiful day. Return the number of beautiful days in the range.

Ans :-
public static int beautifulDays(int i, int j, int k)
    {
        int start = i,beautifulNo=0;
        while(start<=j){
            int reversedStart,p=start;
            if(start>9){
                reversedStart=0;
                while(p!=0){
                    reversedStart=reversedStart*10+p%10;
                    p=p/10;
                }   
            }
            else
                reversedStart=start;
            int DifferenceStartAndReverseStart = 
            Math.Abs(start-reversedStart);
            if(DifferenceStartAndReverseStart%k==0){
                beautifulNo++;
            }
            start++;
        }
        return beautifulNo;
    }

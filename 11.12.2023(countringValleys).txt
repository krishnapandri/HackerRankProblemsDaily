Q1 ) 
An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly  steps, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill, , or a downhill,  step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a  unit change in altitude. 

ans : -     
public static int countingValleys(int steps, string path)
    {
        int mountains = 0 , valleys=0;
        for(int i = 0 ;i<steps;i+=1)
        {
            if(path[i]=='D' && mountains==0)
                valleys+=1;
            if(path[i]=='U')
                mountains+=1;    
            if(path[i]=='D')
                mountains-=1;
        }
        return valleys;
    }

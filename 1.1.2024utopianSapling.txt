The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.

A Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter is planted at the onset of spring. How tall will the tree be after  growth cycles?


Program:-

public static int utopianTree(int n)
    {
        int i = 0,h=1;
        bool isSpring = true;
        if(n==0) return 1;
        while(i!=n){  
            h = isSpring ? 2*h : h+1;
            isSpring=!isSpring; 
            i++;
        }
        return h;
    }
